            <h2>Self-Care... First Line of Defense for Mental Health</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Crew Member Theebhana</h3>
            <h4>Posted on May 16, 2022</h4>
            <p>AKALAKA was created to provide the best support and resources to those who need and give the greatest care. We focus on serving adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their siblings. Sibling care partners may spend lifetimes giving and needing help with activities of daily living (ADLs) and/or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The long-term physical and emotional stress from these daily activities may strain the sibling relationship and other joys of living if one’s mental health is not defended with care.</p>

            <p>Before we get into this article, we want you to know that there are hotlines created to respond to you if you are in crisis. Please reach out to these frontline crisis responders if you need urgent or emergent help:</p>

            <p><i>United States</i></p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Emergency Services – 911</li>
                    <li>Text HOME to 741741 to reach a volunteer Crisis Counselor</li>
                    <li>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline – 1-800-273-8255</li>
               </ul>

            <p><i>Canada</i></p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Canada Suicide Prevention Service (24/7) – 1-833-456-4566</li>
                    <li>Hope for Wellness Help Line – 1-855-242-3310</li>
                    <li>ConnexOntario (resources) – 1-866-531-2600</li>
               </ul>
            
            <p>A primary line of defense for mental health can be self-care. ADLs include care tasks necessary for basic survival: walking (or ambulating), feeding, dressing and grooming, toileting, bathing, transferring (moving from one body position to another). IADLs are care tasks that require organizational and complex thinking skills: managing finances (paying bills and managing financial assets), managing transportation (driving), shopping and meal preparation, housecleaning, managing communication (email, phone), managing medications.</p>

            <p>Physical stress from needing to give or receive assistance on ADLs or IADLs can result in disturbed sleep, fatigue despite adequate rest, headaches, and a weakened immune system. Emotional stress from daily activities can result in depression, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, loss of interest in personal needs or desires, increased resentment toward care partners and other family and friends, loss of satisfaction of being a care partner, helplessness, hopelessness, and isolation.</p>

            <p>Self-care can be defined as “the ability to care for oneself through awareness, self-control, and self-reliance in order to achieve, maintain, or promote optimal health and well-being.” (Martínez et al. 2021)</p>
               <ul>
                    <li><i>Awareness</i> is seen as knowledge or perception of our needs.</li>
                    <li><i>Self-control</i> involves regulating ourselves and emotions. Self-discipline is a part of this category.</li>
                    <li><i>Self-reliance</i> is the ability to make our own decisions, to depend on ourselves. An example is, choosing to start a healthy habit and adhering to the plan.</li>
               </ul>
            
            <p>How can we practice self-care?</p>

            <p><b>Exercise.</b> According to Dr. Mike Evans MD, exercise is the “single best thing we can do our health.” Evans summarizes foundational research in this video to highlight what 30 minutes of walking or aerobic exercise can do for you, all through white board animations.</p>

            <p>The recommended minimum amount of physical activity is 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity exercise. Moderate intensity means that while you are active, you have enough breath to say a short sentence, but not enough to sing.</p>

            <p><b>Nutrition.</b> Today’s food guide uses a healthy plate method - a visual representation of food proportions. One half of the plate is fruits and vegetables of many colours (think of the rainbow). One quarter is protein foods. The remaining quarter is whole grain foods.</p>

            <p><b>Sleep.</b> Sleep hygiene can aid in a good night’s rest. The key is to build a routine before bedtime. Activities should include removing electronic devices from the bedroom or keeping them away from arm’s length, avoiding large meals / caffeine / alcohol, and making sure the bedroom is dark / quiet / relaxing. Going to bed at the same time every night and getting up at the same time every morning helps with consistency, which programs into the bedtime routine.</p>

            <p><b>Therapy.</b> Yoga, mindfulness, meditation and journaling can be used to alleviate care partner stress. Professional counselling and therapy can help build adequate skills.</p>

            <p>Cognitive behaviour therapy provides the skills for clients to challenge their negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviours. The goal is to develop a balanced perspective on the events that occur around us.</p>

            <p>Interpersonal therapy enables clients to self-evaluate the challenges that prevent them from communicating their needs with others. The goal is to improve communication skills, so that their intentions are understood and their needs are met.</p>

            <p>Psychodynamic therapy gives clients the space to uncover unconscious feelings that negatively influence their mood and attitude. The goal is to recognize, understand and manage unconscious feelings. This therapy has been found to be less effective than CBT and interpersonal therapy in managing care partner stress.</p>

            <p>No one, with or without disabilities and caregiving responsibilities, should do care completely alone. Mental health can be more sustainably defended when self-care is supplemented early and often with the second and third lines of defense– home & community care and professional specialist care.</p>

            <p>At AKALAKA, we’re working to enable greater access to home & community care, starting by assisting members who have a Medicaid Home & Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver – for example, the “Innovations Waiver” in North Carolina – with navigating and receiving local and virtual long-term support to increase the independence and reduce the workload of individuals and families. Join us to get the resources and support you need today: <a href="/join">AKALAKA.org/join</a></p>

            <p>AKALAKA is also working to connect members to professional specialists, starting in regions where members make requests. <a href="/join">Join us for assistance with discovering and paying for these specialists.</a></p>

            <h2>A Brother's Story of a Blessing in Disguise</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Lyle Michael S Lasala</h3>
            <h4>Posted on April 8, 2022</h4>
            <p>First, I want to start off by simply not telling my story. I’m a sib, but then again I’m not defined as just a sib. I’ve lived my life, have failed, have triumphed, and have failed again. I owe my strength and my personality to what I’ve learned from my brothers and the character I’ve built.</p>

            <p>It was unique learning about I/DD growing up. Being 1st gen in America and AAPI [Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders], the culture was still relatively unfamiliar with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and how to nurture it. So are my brothers forever slow or is this just a phase? I couldn’t decipher whether it was them being sick or something.</p>

            <p>Turns out it was none of the above. It was a super power. And as I got older, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Leland, my oldest brother, has a great memory. The gentle giant will remember anything from locked memories to video game cheat codes. Say your birthday to him and if you don’t even see him again within the next 5 years and he’ll still remember. Luke, my other older brother, on the other hand hones a special energy that’s kinetic, that is at times magnetic. He loves to dance and hates staying still. But he is also really smart, knows basic sign language and one time cut a lemon in half, inside joke for me. These guys deserve the world, but the world didn’t necessarily give as much love to them from the start, as much as I hoped at least.</p>

            <p>As time went by obviously there were challenges faced, obstacles to overcome, like everybody else. However, every sib experiences unique issues that they and they only can try to solve. When you’re a kid, you’re a kid. These are grown-up problems. My parents provided me with a great childhood, but they also were new to this unique caregiving role as a parent overall, and all my respect to them and all sib parents for instilling the love and care we all wanted. Somedays ASD can be a cold moon. The moon controls the currents of the water, the breeze of the winds. And somedays ASD can be the warmth of the sun. The sun controls the vibration of energy, the warmth of the room, the soul of the heart.</p>

            <p>Zoom past to now, 20 something years later and now it’s safe to say that both my brothers got the love that they needed. There is a community out there that is fresh, that is safe, and that is being more understood day by day. What really came around was watching “As We See It”, an amazon original series showcasing the organic side of ASD and the world that encompasses it.</p>

            <p>Representation truly matters. Seeing someone that acts like you, seems familiar to you, can mean a lot to you. In general, ever since the start of the 2020s, now more than ever before has diversity been actively acknowledged. Acknowledged in the sense that just because someone is different doesn’t mean we can’t value them. There is always beauty in ugly, there is always elegance in crass, there is always nature in nurture.</p>

            <p>Reflection is vital it seems for anyone, for sibs. You can’t go farther unless you look back on where you came from, or you’ll get lost. Keep going.</p>

            <h2>What is Person-Centered Planning?</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Partner LifeCourseOnline</h3>
            <h4>Posted on March 20, 2022</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.lifecourseonline.com/">LifeCourseOnline</a> was designed to make <b>Person-Centered Planning</b> accessible for everyone. But what is Person-Centered Planning exactly? And how do you get started?</p>

            <p><b>What is “Person-Centered Planning”?</b>/<p>
            
            <p>While balancing every appointment, service, and support that goes into managing care, we sometimes forget that care is about more than meeting health needs. Person-centered planning aims to approach care in a holistic way that increases an individual’s quality of life by their own definition. A person-centered approach means focusing on the elements of care, support, and treatment that matter most to the individual at the center of that plan. It rethinks the relationship between people and services to ensure that those receiving care have a real voice in the creation and ongoing management of their own care plan (1, 2).</p>

            <p>Person Centered Planning (PCP) originated in the UK in 2001 as a response to traditional services and supports that felt disconnected and incomplete (2). Although the concept has primarily been used for life planning for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, it is now being embraced as a valuable process for other populations with supported living needs, including children, people with physical disabilities, people with mental health issues, and seniors (3).</p>

            <p>The term ‘person-centered care’ is often used broadly to cover a wide range of principles and methods. There is no single agreed upon definition of the concept. One of the reasons for this is that person-centered care is still an emerging and evolving area. Even the name of this approach is under debate! Many prefer using the term ‘person-directed’ over ‘person-centered’.</p>

            <p>It is, in many ways, impossible to precisely define person-centered practices or care because true person-centered care will always adapt to suit the unique needs, circumstances, and preferences of the individual receiving care (1, 4).</p>

            <p>The Health Foundation, a UK based organization dedicated to building better health and health care, released a framework of person-centered care made up of <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/publications/person-centred-care-made-simple">4 key principles</a>:</p>
               <ol type="1">
                    <li>Affording people dignity, compassion, and respect.</li>
                    <li>Offering coordinated care, support, or treatment.</li>
                    <li>Offering personalized care, support, or treatment.</li>
                    <li>Supporting people to recognize and develop their own strengths and abilities to enable them to live an independent and fulfilling life.</li>
               </ol>
            
            <p>These principles may seem straightforward, but when care responsibility falls to large systems (or even across multiple caregivers), they can easily become deprioritized.</p>

            <p><b>What would a Person-Centered approach mean for you or your loved one?</b></p>
            
            <p>Whether you’re using PCP to determine service needs, embark on future planning, or reevaluate your current supports, weaving the key principles of person-centered care into your practices naturally leads to higher quality of care and better outcomes.</p>
               <ul>
                    <li><b>More Relevant Planning</b>
                        <p><i>Everyone’s wants and needs are unique and evolve as we age. A truly person-centered approach takes this into account, even throughout times of transition or crisis, allowing for more relevant future planning.</i></p></li>

                    <li><b>More Effective Use of Resources</b>
                        <p><i>A one-size-fits-all approach to planning means we are forcing similar solutions on different people in different circumstances. This leads to wasted energy and resources since what is effective for one person may not work for another.</i></p></li>

                    <li><b>A Stronger Support Network</b>
                        <p><i>A person-centered approach leads to stronger and longer lasting relationships between individuals and caregivers. Providing person-centered care demonstrates the respect and receptiveness that everyone expects to receive from those who are there to support them.</i></p></li>

                    <li><b>Increased Independence</b>
                        <p><i>Finally, a person-centered approach promotes independence and self-advocacy. It encourages the person at the center of that plan to articulate their needs and surround themselves with people who are willing to support their unique vision for their good life.</i></p></li>
               </ul>
            
            <p><b>How to get started</b></p>
               
            <p>To start implementing a person-centered approach into your care plan, you can begin with as little as changing your frame of mind to be more individual focused. You can also ask your local services and support teams if they implement or follow PCP principles and if you can become more involved in your care planning.</p>

            <p>Once you’re ready to bring a Person-Centered approach into your or your loved one’s care plan, LifeCourseOnline is here to help. We believe this life-changing method should be available to anyone receiving or providing care, no matter where you are located or whether your local service providers have embraced person-centered practices. As a self-guided online platform and program, LifeCourseOnline allows you to create a personalized plan and implement person-centered thinking across your support network.</p>

            <h2>Growth through Love and Action... from Isolation to Community</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Katelyn McInerney</h3>
            <h4>Posted on January 31, 2022</h4>
            <p>My sister paced the hallway, screaming. Her hands covered her ears. My mother stood next to her, still dripping from the bath. Mom calmly encouraged meditative breathing but my sister kept yelling about what the voices in her head were telling her. I could only watch.</p>

            <p>My autistic sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 11. Auditory and visual hallucinations are a hallmark of Bipolar I, and they can manifest in a most frightening way.</p>

            <p>The fear and unpredictability of my sister’s disorder makes me feel powerless. That night, we were scheduled to attend a family dinner at my grandmother’s house. Those plans changed at the last minute as my parents struggled to stabilize the situation.</p>

            <p>I felt helpless. I felt scared for my sister. I felt frustrated. I felt angry that once again plans changed to accommodate my sister’s needs. I felt alone as my parents focused their energies on her. By the time she fell asleep, my parents were emotionally drained and had nothing left to give to me. I felt guilty.</p>

            <p>My younger sister is epileptic, autistic, profoundly ADHD, Bipolar I and has a language processing disorder. To say that she has struggled throughout her life is an understatement. Watching her battle bullying from peers, overcome neglect from teachers and other adults, and struggle with studies that came more easily for me was very challenging to witness. Feeling like a bystander while my sister was excluded from our community caused me to feel shame and guilt, and I struggled trying to find a way to help.</p>

            <p>Over time, an idea formed—what I felt in these situations couldn’t be unique. I was sure that if I had these feelings, other children who have siblings with special needs must also feel the same way. I needed to find those other “special siblings” and bring us together. We needed each other.</p>

            <p>In July 2017, I created <a href="https://www.specialsiblingsbham.org">Special Siblings</a>, a support group for kids like me. I facilitate monthly meetings that allow my peers to be heard and validated. I coordinate with local mental health professionals who volunteer as guest speakers. We promote understanding and acceptance of ourselves and our siblings. Not only did I find a community, but I’ve become one of its leaders. Over time, common themes have emerged: feeling that they need to be perfect, feeling they cannot express their feelings at home, feeling their homelife is not normal, feeling their problems are minimized, feeling jealous, feeling isolated, feeling frustrated when faced with intolerance, feeling they are asked to do too much, and feeling they grow up too quickly.</p>

            <p>Four months later, Special Siblings was granted 501(c)(3) status. It is my hope that one day, rather than feeling fear or frustration, we can all be the voices of comfort for our siblings.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, Special Siblings has taught me to be a better person. By empathizing with other children in the group, my empathy for myself has grown. I now realize that my struggles are not unique. For years I suffered in silence. My feelings are validated and normalized within this group.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the benefits of having a sibling with special needs are endless. They include becoming more empathetic, more responsible and resilient. While these are incredible traits, many children have feelings they are often ashamed of. Many of these children suffer in silence, having nowhere to turn and no one to understand them. Additionally, many parents are too exhausted from handling the affairs of the special needs sibling to focus on the neurotypical child. As a result, the issues common to these neurotypical siblings often go unnoticed and a gap persists in our community.</p>

            <p>As I grow up, so does my sister. No longer does she have to worry about middle school bullies, but she does have to worry about keeping employment, struggling to live independently, and maintaining mood stability. I still worry about her every day, but those worries are overshadowed by the love I have for her, and the support that myself and her entire team provides her. I am confident that she will be able to live out a fulfilling life, and I now know that I have the tools I need to be a supportive sister to her.</p>

            <h2>Who are sibling caregivers?</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Mary Landis Gaston</h3>
            <h4>Posted on January 24, 2022</h4>
            <p>Whether you have been part of AKALAKA from the beginning or this is your first time hearing about us, you may be asking, who exactly are sibling caregivers? Am I a sibling caregiver? We hope to elucidate on this question and expand on the roles of sibling caregivers.</p>

            <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
               <ul>
                    <li>There is no single definition or term to describe the diverse ways in which we care for our siblings with I/DD.</li>
                    <li>Being a sibling caregiver comes with challenges–financial, emotional, mental, and physical ones included–as well as joys, such as developing resilience and empathy.</li>
                    <li>We welcome all siblings, regardless of what part of the caregiving journey you are on!</li>
               </ul>
               
            <p>The definition of a sibling caregiver is difficult to identify as its boundaries are fluid. Some in our community care for their siblings with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) on a daily basis. Depending on their sibling’s goals and support needs, the caregiver may help with home & community-based services including bathing, dressing, eating, and transport, as well as provide a supportive environment. Other caregivers may rarely see their siblings with I/DD but do “share the load.” They actively participate in medical decision-making, emotional support, or other caregiving tasks. Sociology, psychology, and disability research reflect this lack of clear definition. In a review of 29 studies about sibling caregivers, sociologist Meghan Burke found that most studies did not even define caregiving. The ones that did define it gave a variety of definitions. For example, tasks such as guardianship, residential arrangement, and companionship were considered part of the sibling caregiver role. In one study, co-residence helped to define sibling caregiving (Lee and Burke). We are a diverse group, so using one definition to identify sibling caregivers is nearly impossible.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that even within our own community, the term “sibling caregiver” is just one of many terms used to identify siblings of individuals with I/DD. You may also hear the terms “care partner,” “caretaker,” “carer,” or “care provider,” among others. Although these terms have similar meanings, each has a slightly different connotation. For example, “sibling care partner” may invoke images of caring for someone with I/DD alongside a group of others, while “sibling caregiver” may invoke images of being the primary person providing care.</p>

            <p><b>If you have a sibling with I/DD, which term do you relate to the most to describe yourself?</b></p>
            
            <p>Because AKALAKA is a community of support and resources for siblings who care for siblings with I/DD, we recognize the real challenges that come with being a caregiver. By acknowledging these challenges, we are not saying that being a sibling caregiver is a harmful or otherwise negative experience. Rather, we are honest about what it means to be a caregiver so that we can better understand and support each other. Being a sibling caregiver can affect us emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially.</p>

            <p>One of the clearest challenges of caregiving is the emotional/psychological effect. While this looks different for every sibling, research tells us siblings of those with I/DD have higher rates of anxiety and depression, as well as difficulty interacting with peers (Landman). For example, many siblings struggle with isolation, which is something that those in our own AKALAKA community have expressed. Some siblings experience the negative effects of “parentification,” i.e., growing up quickly and feeling responsible for their sibling(s) with I/DD. The parentification phenomenon can lead to distorted views of how much caretaking is normal in a friendship or relationship (Landman).</p>

            <p>Another major challenge for caregivers of any type, including siblings, is financial stress. More than 1 in 6 Americans working either part-time or full-time are caregivers for an elderly or disabled relative or friend. The vast majority of these caregivers–at least 70%–have difficulties at work due to the stress of caregiving. These difficulties include having to rearrange work schedules, decrease work hours, and take unpaid leave to fulfill caregiving duties. Ultimately, these caregivers may lose wages, health insurance, or other benefits (Family Caregiver Alliance).</p>

            <p>Despite these challenges, many sibling caregivers experience positive benefits from their caregiving roles. Adaptability, tolerance, and empathy are only a few of the characteristics that sibling caregivers share. Research about sibling caregivers has started to focus more on the positive rather than the negative outcomes (Landman). There is a true sense of personal growth and happiness that comes from being a sibling to someone with I/DD and watching them thrive in their own ways (Lee and Burke).</p>

            <p>As we can see, there is a spectrum of what caregiving means and how it affects us. Sibling caregivers are a diverse group of people with unique roles and challenges. Here at AKALAKA, we welcome anyone who is or has been a sibling to an individual with I/DD, no matter what part of the journey you are facing and no matter what role you fill. Through education, peer matching, online seminars and social gatherings, we aim to directly address the challenges that sibling caregivers face.</p>

            <h2>Almost Heaven... Freedom Found in Country Roads</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Diana Pastora Carson</h3>
            <h4>Posted on December 29, 2021</h4>
            <p>John Denver’s “Country Roads” may hold deep meaning for many people, but for my brother and me, it symbolizes childhood bond, the comforts of nature, a triumphant exodus from institutionalization, and return to home and family.

               At a time when autism was considered a rare childhood disorder, and was thought to be the result of a “refrigerator mother,” my parents did everything they could do to be good parents to Joaquin. There was no internet or Facebook support group to turn to. So they teetered between bewilderment and exhaustion, and extraordinary creativity and affection. For years, Mom and Dad slept with one eye open; had several varieties of locks on each door of the house that led to the outside world; mortgaged their house to buy him a swimming pool; and showered Joaquin with love and laughter.

               Due to public stares and intolerance, there weren’t many places our family could go for entertainment. We sometimes dared to test our luck at McDonald’s Playland. Depending on who else was there, we might all enjoy an evening of fine dining. And we always had success throwing on our footie pajamas, throwing our blankets and pillows into the back of our station wagon, and taking Dad’s homemade buttered popcorn in a brown paper bag to the drive-in movie theater. Joaquin was always down for a ride in the car, and for rolling himself up into a tightblanket like a rolled taco.

               Although drive-in movies were a close runner up, the all-time favorite, and the safest bet in entertainment for our family was a drive to the country. Joaquin, who was perpetually wound up and in motion, could unwind there. On weekends, we’d drive miles and miles out of our suburban neighborhood, and onto winding dirt roads lined with aged oak trees, brush, and wildflowers. We’d venture into ranches where barbed wire fences were the only barriers between us and herds of cattle. Mom packed sandwiches, potato salad, fruit, and drinks in a large cooler. We had everything we needed and nowhere else that we had to be. We just let the spirit move us from one spot to the next. We flowed with nature, and with Joaquin’s bliss. Whatever brought him joy brought us joy.

               On these rural adventures, Joaquin could breathe out all his anxieties founded in the energies of societal gawkers and judgers. And he could breathe in complete freedom and peace. He could breathe out tornadoes of pent-up emotion, and breathe in fresh springs of self-love. Joaquin could be Joaquin. Pure Joaquin energy, one with nature.

               People have sometimes asked me if I thought it was the smells or sights or sounds of the country that Joaquin found mesmerizing. And maybe he did love any one or all of those features. But I think the spatial and personal freedom he experienced there was his “almost heaven.” When out in the country, he wasn’t subject to abuse where the sole “education” goal was control. On those country roads, Joaquin didn’t have to worry about being squirted in the face with a water bottle at school for not being focused on tasks. He didn’t have to endure vinegar being squirted into his mouth if he tried to bite in retaliation for their abuse. He didn’t have to fight against the time out room of the physical restraints that turned his bright smile into contorted cries of rage. In the country, Joaquin could communicate with the wind, and the wind would respond gently, lovingling, to his every whim. He could share his babbled stories with the sun, and it would warm him with reassurance that he was worthy of that warmth. He could chirp in unison with the birds, spread open his winds, and let his soul soar to a place where he belonged.

               When Joaquin felt loved, appreciated, and free, he could relax. Everyone in the family could relax.

               At home, Mom mostly played flamenco records and Dad played oldies but goodies from the 1950’s. But in elementary school, one of my teachers played the guitar and taught our class to sing “Country Roads.” I learned the lyrics in one day. And for years, each night at bedtime, I sang Joaquin to sleep with that song.

               Fast forward to 17 years old, 6 feet tall, and 200 pounds of rage. Joaquin was forced by his “special” school to take psychotropic medications to control HIS behaviors. He had severe allergic reactions to those medications, causing extreme aggression, and rendering him and our family hostage to a system not equipped for, nor interested in, humanely supporting behavioral crises. Joaquin was taken to a state institution 2 hours away from home, where human degradation was also the norm.

               Our family was devastated and in mourning over this great loss. However, every weekend, we took that 2-hour drive to the institution and back, to visit Joaquin, and take him out to be with nature. For 15 years, we did this.

               We promised Joaquin that we would take him home again. And this time, we would protect him. He would never again be subject to restrain, seclusion, and abuse. We could create a place where he belonged, build around his strengths, wants, and needs. And we know, it had to be on a country road.

               After 3 years in court, we finally won our case. This year marks the 10 year anniversary of Joaquin living in his own home at the end of our beautiful and peaceful dirt road, where the breeze embraces his every whim, the sun warms his heart, and the birds greet him each morning. Almost heaven.

            <h2>Navigating Home & Community-Based Services (HCBS)</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Mary Landis Gaston</h3>
            <h4>Posted on December 20, 2021</h4>
            <p>One of our goals here at AKALAKA is to help sibling caregivers of artists, musicians, athletes, academics, entrepreneurs (AKA “individuals”) living with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) understand the complexities of disability services. If you become an AKALAKA member and participate in our introductory class, you will receive detailed lessons on how to navigate Medicaid’s Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver program. For now, we want to provide you with a brief overview of what HCBS are and how they can improve the lives of those with I/DD.

               The purpose of HCBS is to allow eligible individuals to receive a variety of caregiving and medical services in their homes and communities rather than in institutions. HCBS are typically available for older adults and those with disabilities, illnesses, and substance use disorders (“Home and Community-Based Services”). We will be focusing specifically on how HCBS apply to those with I/DD.

               Decades of research and court cases formed the Medicaid waiver program that allows states to provide HCBS within broad federal guidelines. During the majority of the 20th century, individuals with I/DD lived in Medicaid-funded institutions. However, researchers found that at least one third of these individuals could have lived at home if they had supportive services available in their communities (Duckett 123). That finding, combined with advocates bringing nationwide reports of dissatisfaction, neglect and abuse in institutions to the forefront, spurred federal legislators to direct funding towards homes and communities. In 1983, Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This allowed for individuals with I/DD to receive up to seven medical services in their homes instead of in institutions. These services included case management, homemaker, health aide, personal care, adult day care, habilitation, and respite care (“Home and Community-Based Services 1915(c)”).

               HCBS are not exactly the same in every state within the U.S. While the federal agency, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), partners with states to oversee Medicaid administration, the states themselves determine who is eligible for coverage and what types of services are available. Today, 47 governments, including Washington, D.C., have at least one 1915(c) waiver (“Home and Community Based Services Authorities”). States with a 1915(c) waiver must meet 4 requirements: 1) Provide waiver services that will not cost more than services in an institution. 2) Protect people’s health and welfare. 3) Ensure that provider standards meet the needs of the target population. 4) Follow an individualized and person-centered plan of care for 1915(c) services. Beyond these requirements, states can, at their own discretion, determine where the services can be applied within the state, which groups are eligible for the services, and how a person’s income factors into eligibility (“Home and Community-Based Services 1915(c)”). For example, someone who would typically be eligible for Medicaid if they were living in an institution can still receive HCBS, as long as the state allows it.

               There have been 17 broad categories of services that HCBS has covered: case management, round-the-clock services, supported employment, day services, nursing, home delivered meals, rent and food expenses for live-in caregiver, home-based services, caregiver support, other mental health and behavioral services, other health and therapeutic services, services supporting self-direction, participant training, equipment/technology/modifications, non-medical transportation, community transition services, and other services (“Medicaid HCBS Taxonomy Category”). As you can see, the health of caregivers has not been left out of the picture. If you have not yet tapped into caregiver support services, you may want to contact your sibling’s case manager to determine what support you could receive!

               We know that all of this information can be complicated and confusing. We encourage you to search online for information about your state’s 1915(c) waiver. A good starting place is Medicaid’s State Waivers List, which provides descriptions for each state’s waiver programs.

            <h2>No Longer Alone</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Mary Landis Gaston</h3>
            <h4>Posted on November 29, 2021</h4>
            <p>I have often felt a void between myself and my peers. As a caregiver for my profoundly disabled brother, James, I spent many nights in high school awake and comforting him after a seizure. My daily life, which consisted of switching between homework and G-tube feedings, was not something my peers could imagine, much less talk about with me. In college and beyond, I began to speak weekly with my parents about medical decisions for James. I am passionate about sharing how a lesson from class or an observation at my current job as a medical scribe could enlighten us about James’s conditions. Still, learning how to simultaneously be a caregiver and a young adult, as well as a medical decision-maker and a pre-med student, has not been an easy task. I cannot deny the grief that accompanies being a sister to someone who will not live to grow old, all the while knowing that none of my friends understand my deepest pains.

               Over the past year, I began to recognize that this void has turned into a chronic sense of isolation. Despite having many supportive friends, I have found it difficult to share with them my complex experiences with James: my struggles and worries as his older sister but also the simultaneous joy I have from knowing and loving him. After moving to North Carolina in 2019, I continued in this pattern of isolation, wondering if I would ever feel connected to my peers. Whether due to the busyness of life or a lack of exposure, I had never heard of a sibling support group. However, when I learned a few months ago about Victoria’s plan to start AKALAKA, it suddenly hit me: why have I never been a part of something like this? Before even joining the first AKALAKA cohort, I knew that this group would be a place where I could find both logistical and emotional resources to support myself and my family in our journey of caring for my brother. Earlier this year, James was enrolled in the children’s Medicaid waiver program in my home state, so the educational aspect of AKALAKA could not have come at a more perfect time.

               Although the AKALAKA cohort meetings have been online, the sense of genuine support and care is palpable. I have not needed to explain or justify life with James. I can simply say “I have a special needs brother,” and people really get it. They know what it is like to face the unknown and struggle with questions about what our siblings’ lives will look like or how we will care for them in the future. One of my favorite moments of being a part of AKALAKA was meeting one-on-one with another sibling in the group. We shared the things that our little brothers like to do: she told me that her brother loves going out to eat steak, and I told her that my brother loves to be pushed around the neighborhood in his wheelchair. Our brothers may be very different, but we both can know the joy that we feel when we witness our siblings smile, laugh, or accomplish even the small things, like eating a good steak.

               I am deeply grateful that AKALAKA is available for siblings to not only learn about the complexities of disability services but also to connect with one another in real ways. Because of AKALAKA and the people who are a part of it, that void I have felt for so long is slowly disappearing. I am no longer alone.

            <h2>What is "I/DD"?</h2>
            <h3>By AKALAKA Member Mary Landis Gaston</h3>
            <h4>Posted on November 28, 2021</h4>
            <p>AKALAKA and its blog, Taking Care of Siblings, are here to support siblings of individuals with I/DD. What exactly does I/DD mean, and where does the term originate? We hope that we can answer these questions for you today, or help you learn more if you are already familiar with I/DD.

               I/DD is an acronym for “Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,” which are defined during a person’s childhood, or before they are 22 years old (American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities). Developmental disabilities (DD) include language, learning, physical, or behavioral impairments. Common DD diagnoses include, but are not limited to, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, and intellectual disability (Benjamin Zablotsky et al.). Intellectual disabilities include delays of mobility, speech, social cues, or memory (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

               In the United States, I/DD is a federally recognized term. We use the term I/DD here at AKALAKA because one of our goals is to help our members navigate federal disability services, primarily Medicaid’s Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver program in each state. If you are caring for someone who qualifies for these services, you will often see the term “I/DD.” You may also see the variations “ID,” “DD,” “ID/DD,” or “D/ID.” However, we should all be aware that some individuals or organizations may use terms other than I/DD. At AKALAKA, we always respect terms that someone chooses to describe their identity!

               Although I/DD, as well as variations of this term, are now common in federal legislation, they are relatively recent developments in legislative history. It was not until 1975 that DD first appeared, specifically in the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (The Arc). Previous federal documentation had used terms such as “developmental abnormalities” and “mental retardation” (Federal Register). The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, which builds on the original law of 1975, provides federal funding to four resources: State Councils on Developmental Disabilities (Councils), State Protection and Advocacy Systems (P&As), University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research & Services (UCEDDs), and Projects of National Significance (PNS) (Administration on Community Living). You can read more about the DD Act and its impact here.

               Many AKALAKA participants, adult siblings of persons with I/DD, have voiced their feelings of isolation on their journeys as siblings. We know what it feels like to be different from your peers and to struggle to manage care for yourself, your sibling(s), and even the rest of your family. Above all, we want you to know that you are not alone! About 17% of children aged 3 through 17 in the United States have intellectual or developmental disabilities, and 1 million of these children will become adults in the next decade (CDC). That’s a lot of potential siblings out there whom we hope will join the growing community of AKALAKA– a community that is here to help you take care of yourselves, your siblings, and your communities.
